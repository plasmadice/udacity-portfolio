## Portfolio Project for Udacity Nanodegree

#### Usage
Open `index.html` in browser.

#### Purpose
This was created primarily for Udacity's Nanodegree Project 1. I fully intend to recreate this using React. I'm aiming for an elegant and simplistic approach.

##### Notables
This website is responsive. It has several breakpoints to keep things in order and presentable

Inspiration was taken from several portfolios and websites.
